[Last November](https://ferrell.io/2017/11/30/new-blog/), I wrote a short blog post about how I finally had a space to blog about my technical adventures and how excited I was to turn over a new leaf in my adventures within the tech field. _Welllllll_, life tends to happen and there are always plenty of excuses. Since writing that post, I've accomplished a lot (in my eyes)...

* Passed the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam...
* Passed the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator exam...
* Taken on a more senior role (and title) within my current organization...
* Dove in deep with some fun tech (Chef is my new best friend, as is Python in general!)...
* Submitted my first CFP for next year's PowerShell & DevOps Summit (you should [submit one too!](https://www.papercall.io/summit2019))...
* Signed up for my first lightning talk ever ([coming up on September 19th!](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/75))...
* Worked a TON with AWS Lambda as well as Google Apps Scripts to build out Serverless functions and API's...
* ...and last but most amazingly, became a parent (holy crap this is still surreal!)

This past year has been a true experience for me, but the one thing I **honestly** regret is not dedicating more time to step away from learning to do some good old fashioned brain dumps and document my journey. 

To me, this is truly important because:

1. It helps you recite the things you've learned over time, effectively practicing those again in your head and not in your editor (well, maybe not in your normal workspace anyway).
    * You don't have your code to copy and paste chunks from all over the place to do what you need to do, so you're forced to run through the process in your head first.
2. It gives you a chance to spread the same knowledge you have absorbed in a new light.
    * How many times have you figured out an answer after reading posts, Stack Overflow articles, etc, only to say "I wish someone had just explained it _this_ way!"? Now is your chance!
3. It provides a way to look back on that complicated thing you figured out forever ago.
    * Code comments are out, blogging is in! ðŸ™ƒ
4. It helps the community improve by spreading the wealth of knowledge you've gained.
    * Seriously, how many blog posts have you found buried answers in after hours of digging?! Even if it's just one, it's priceless!

These are just some of the reasons that I'm pledging to be a more consistent blogger and a valuable resource to everyone following in my footsteps, walking alongside me, or even to those I look up to and hope to fill their shoes one day. If I can help one person reach their dream while I reach for mine, I'll be happy.

I should have my first actual blog post coming up within the next few days, so stay tuned!

**Let's build together!**
