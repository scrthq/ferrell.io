So, I'm _finally_ up to the point where I have a place to start writing about my explorations with PowerShell development, DevOps learnings, and general life things.

```powershell
Get-Creative | Where-Object {$_.Content -eq "Useful" -or $_.Content -eq "Random"} | Format-Blog
```

I'm looking forward to sharing my headspace with you! Stay tuned for upcoming posts!
