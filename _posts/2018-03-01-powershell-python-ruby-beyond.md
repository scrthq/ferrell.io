  A work-in-progress scratch pad to help with learning new scripting languages

```powershell
PS > Get-CommandEquivalent -Language Ruby -Command '$array = @()'

array = []
```

#### Why?

I love PowerShell and would probably be perfectly fine with staying in my comfort zone, but I'm too curious not to explore (it probably helps a bit that my day to day job necessitates learning other scripting languages typically involved with DevOps roles too).

This is my scratch pad where I can continuously write down tips and tricks and common syntax equivalents for multiple languages. Things like `Write-Host` > `print`, creating functions in various languages, etc.

If you find this post helpful, feel free to bookmark it! I intend to update it often as I explore myself (or just have time to update my scratch pad). If you can think of a better way to write a process in another language, please don't hesitate to leave a comment!

**Enjoy!**
