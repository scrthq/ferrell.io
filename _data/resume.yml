work:
  - company: PennyMac Loan Services, LLC
    position: VP, Architect, Cloud Platform Engineering
    website: https://www.pennymac.com
    startDate: 2020-09-01
    endDate: ""
    summary: >
      As a member of the Cloud Platform Engineering team, I am the owner,
      developer and SME for multiple cloud platforms such as Azure DevOps, Chef,
      Amazon Web Services, GitLab/GitLab CI, and Google Cloud Platform. As an
      architect, I am also involved in architectural reviews and system design.

      My daily workload shifts between writing Python, Ruby, PowerShell, and
      Bash across CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code. I also work hand-in-hand
      with development teams across the organization daily, gathering feedback
      in order to provide the best platforms for them to build upon. When I am not
      writing code, I am usually mentoring or working on documentation.
    highlights:
      - Enabled self-service capabilities for developers to create build and release
        pipelines that could deploy all the way to production while ensuring all
        guardrails for security and change management were enforced.
      - Enabled easier shifting from legacy, monolithic .NET code bases to FaaS
        and containers running .NET Core / Python via centralized CI/CD pipeline
        templates.
      - Migrated the company's largest development division from TFS 2015 to Azure
        DevOps Server 2020.1.1.

  - company: PennyMac Loan Services, LLC
    position: Sr. Systems/DevOps Engineer
    website: https://www.pennymac.com
    startDate: 2019-01-01
    endDate: 2020-09-01
    summary: >
      As a senior Systems and DevOps engineer, my primary focus was working with
      development teams building infrastructure-as-code and maintaining CI/CD
      pipelines. I was also responsible for maintaining our identity platforms such
      as OneLogin, Active Directory, and AWS IAM, as well as involved with our
      architectural review committee.

      My daily workload involved heavy Python for infrastructure-as-code and
      supporting microservices, Ruby for configuration management, and PowerShell and
      Bash for CI/CD and general automation depending on the OS I am working on.

    highlights:
      - Built out a multi-tier Azure DevOps Server environment to increase internal
        development agility.
      - Built patterns for consuming secrets securely from AWS Secrets Manager from
        CloudFormation before it was supported.
      - Established full CloudFormation support for Amazon Connect to enable our
        Servicing team to treat customer-contact centers as code and align with
        a traditional SDLC, including routing, bots and queue management as code.

  - company: PennyMac Loan Services, LLC
    position: Systems Engineer
    website: https://www.pennymac.com
    startDate: 2015-10-15
    endDate: 2019-01-01
    summary: >
      As a Systems Engineer, my primary focus was building and maintaining our
      Windows Server infrastructure across both our on-premises data centers
      running vSphere as well as AWS. I was also the primary owner/admin for our
      Google Workspace domain, including automating much of that via PSGSuite.

      My daily workload primarily focused on PowerShell for automating deployments
      and anything else, Ruby for configuration management via Chef, and Python
      for writing infrastructure-as-code. I was also heavily involved with automating
      tasks and reporting surrounding Active Directory.

    highlights:
      - Automated malicious email quarantine and notification to dramatically
        decrease risk of infection to end users.
      - Integrated SQL server job failures with ServiceNow's Event Management.
      - Implemented custom automation to manage entitlement provisioning in
        various systems where there was no way to accomplish it out-of-the-box.

  - company: PennyMac Loan Services, LLC
    position: Operations Engineer
    website: https://www.pennymac.com
    startDate: 2015-04-13
    endDate: 2015-10-15
    summary: >
      As an Operations Engineer, my primary focus was monitoring, troubleshooting
      and escalating issues that occurred across our infrastructure. While I was in
      this role, I moved from graveyard to swing to day shift where the responsibilities
      differed significantly.

      My time was spent primarily writing PowerShell and Python in order to make the daily
      manual tasks easier to perform so I could focus on learning more PowerShell and Python.
      I was in only this initial position for a short period of time until I was promoted
      to Systems Engineer and had my workload adjusted based on performance.

    highlights:
      - Developed automation for provisioning/deprovisioning resources in Google and
        Active Directory to meet SLAs.
      - Automated email collection via Gmail API for customer-contact tracking and
        productivity metrics.
      - Automated multiple processes for my team that were previously manual tasks.
      - Built a Windows Rundeck node to fill a knowledge gap and enable other team members to easily run
        jobs and scripts in a safe, contained environment.

    position: Founder/Developer
    website: http://vaporshell.io
    startDate: 2015-12-01
    endDate: ""
    summary: >
      SCRT HQ (Secret Headquarters) is an organization that I started to
      house the personal projects that I am developing. These are primarily
      PowerShell modules that I felt would be mutually beneficial for the
      general public as well as myself/my workplace, created out of either a
      current need in my role or pure curiosity. Most of the modules that I
      publish are REST API wrappers or .NET SDK wrappers, although I do have a
      number of modules I have yet to push that are for more Windows-admin
      centric tasks.
    highlights:
      - Developed VaporShell, a PowerShell module to assist in AWS
        CloudFormation template building and stack management.
      - Developed vscode-gitter, the first extension for Visual Studio Code to
        send code snippets/files directly to Gitter from the editor
      - Developed PSGSuite, a PowerShell module that wraps Google's various
        API's, enabling automation capabilities with G Suite / Google Drive for
        system administrators

  - company: Broadvoice
    position: Enterprise Sales & Support Engineer
    website: https://www.broadvoice.com/
    startDate: 2014-02-01
    endDate: 2015-04-10
    summary: >
      As a Sales and Support Engineer for our enterprise customers, I was involved
      with working with our Sales team to information around the technical
      implementation of the hardware, software and overall service we provided
      as a VoIP company. Our customers were ours for the length of their contract as
      well, we were their dedicated TAMs after signing.
    highlights:
      - Originally hired as a Tier I technician, assigned to the routing department while still in the probation period
        due to skills shown with identifying routing issues with deep packet inspection.
      - Chosen within the first 6 months of employment to move up to our select business engineering department
        due to the ability to absorb knowledge quickly and eagerness to learn and expand my skill-set. Chosen out of a
        pool of ~60 residential technical support agents to move up to the much smaller business department, most of
        which had been at the company considerably longer than myself at that point.
