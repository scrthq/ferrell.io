    location: Remote
    summary: >
      Started as an Operations Engineer, moved to Systems Engineer, then Sr.
      Systems/DevOps Engineer, and finally to VP, Architect, Cloud Platform Engineering.

      As a member of the Cloud Platform Engineering team, I was the owner,
      developer and SME for multiple cloud platforms such as Azure DevOps, Chef,
      Amazon Web Services, GitLab/GitLab CI, and Google Cloud Platform. As an
      architect, I was also involved in architectural reviews and system design.

      My daily workload shifts between writing Python, Ruby, PowerShell, and Bash across CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code. I also work hand-in-hand with development teams across the organization daily, gathering feedback in order to provide the best platforms for them to build upon. When I was not writing code, I was usually mentoring or working on documentation.
    highlights:
      - Enabled self-service capabilities for developers to create build and
        release pipelines that could deploy all the way to production while
        ensuring all guardrails for security and change management were
        enforced.
      - Enabled easier shifting from legacy, monolithic .NET code bases to FaaS
        and containers running .NET Core / Python via centralized CI/CD pipeline
        templates.
      - Migrated the company's largest development division from TFS 2015 to
        Azure DevOps Server 2020.1.1.
      - Built out a multi-tier Azure DevOps Server environment to increase
        internal development agility.
      - Built patterns for consuming secrets securely from AWS Secrets Manager
        from CloudFormation before it was supported.
      - Established full CloudFormation support for Amazon Connect to enable our
        Servicing team to treat customer-contact centers as code and align with
        a traditional SDLC, including routing, bots and queue management as
        code.
      - Automated malicious email quarantine and notification to dramatically
        decrease risk of infection to end users.
      - Integrated SQL server job failures with ServiceNow's Event Management.
      - Implemented custom automation to manage entitlement provisioning in
        various systems where there was no way to accomplish it out-of-the-box.
      - Developed automation for provisioning/deprovisioning resources in Google
        and Active Directory to meet SLAs.
      - Automated email collection via Gmail API for customer-contact tracking
        and productivity metrics.
      - Automated multiple processes for my team that were previously manual
        tasks.
      - Built a Windows Rundeck node to fill a knowledge gap and enable other
        team members to easily run jobs and scripts in a safe, contained
        environment.

    location: Canoga Park, CA
    summary: >
      As a Sales and Support Engineer for our enterprise customers, I was
      involved with working with our Sales team to information around the
      technical implementation of the hardware, software and overall service we
      provided as a VoIP company. Our customers were ours for the length of
      their contract as well, we were their dedicated TAMs after signing.
    highlights:
      - Originally hired as a Tier I technician, assigned to the routing
        department while still in the probation period due to skills shown with
        identifying routing issues with deep packet inspection.
      - Chosen within the first 6 months of employment to move up to our select
        business engineering department due to the ability to absorb knowledge
        quickly and eagerness to learn and expand my skill-set. Chosen out of a
        pool of ~60 residential technical support agents to move up to the much
        smaller business department, most of which had been at the company
        considerably longer than myself at that point.
