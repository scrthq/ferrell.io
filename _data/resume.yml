    summary: >
      As a member of the Cloud Platform Engineering team, I was the owner,
      developer and SME for multiple cloud platforms such as Azure DevOps, Chef,
      Amazon Web Services, GitLab/GitLab CI, and Google Cloud Platform. As an
      architect, I was also involved in architectural reviews and system design.

      My daily workload shifts between writing Python, Ruby, PowerShell, and Bash across CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code. I also work hand-in-hand with development teams across the organization daily, gathering feedback in order to provide the best platforms for them to build upon. When I was not writing code, I was usually mentoring or working on documentation.
    highlights:
      - Enabled self-service capabilities for developers to create build and
        release pipelines that could deploy all the way to production while
        ensuring all guardrails for security and change management were
        enforced.
      - Enabled easier shifting from legacy, monolithic .NET code bases to FaaS
        and containers running .NET Core / Python via centralized CI/CD pipeline
        templates.
      - Migrated the company's largest development division from TFS 2015 to
        Azure DevOps Server 2020.1.1.

    summary: >
      As a senior Systems and DevOps engineer, my primary focus was working with
      development teams building infrastructure-as-code and maintaining CI/CD
      pipelines. I was also responsible for maintaining our identity platforms
      such as OneLogin, Active Directory, and AWS IAM, as well as involved with
      our architectural review committee.

      My daily workload involved heavy Python for infrastructure-as-code and supporting microservices, Ruby for configuration management, and PowerShell and Bash for CI/CD and general automation depending on the OS I was working on.
    highlights:
      - Built out a multi-tier Azure DevOps Server environment to increase
        internal development agility.
      - Built patterns for consuming secrets securely from AWS Secrets Manager
        from CloudFormation before it was supported.
      - Established full CloudFormation support for Amazon Connect to enable our
        Servicing team to treat customer-contact centers as code and align with
        a traditional SDLC, including routing, bots and queue management as
        code.

    summary: >
      As a Systems Engineer, my primary focus was building and maintaining our
      Windows Server infrastructure across both our on-premises data centers
      running vSphere as well as AWS. I was also the primary owner/admin for our
      Google Workspace domain, including automating much of that via PSGSuite.

      My daily workload primarily focused on PowerShell for automating deployments and anything else, Ruby for configuration management via Chef, and Python for writing infrastructure-as-code. I was also heavily involved with automating tasks and reporting surrounding Active Directory.
    highlights:
      - Automated malicious email quarantine and notification to dramatically
        decrease risk of infection to end users.
      - Integrated SQL server job failures with ServiceNow's Event Management.
      - Implemented custom automation to manage entitlement provisioning in
        various systems where there was no way to accomplish it out-of-the-box.

    summary: >
      As an Operations Engineer, my primary focus was monitoring,
      troubleshooting and escalating issues that occurred across our
      infrastructure. While I was in this role, I moved from graveyard to swing
      to day shift where the responsibilities differed significantly.

      My time was spent primarily writing PowerShell and Python in order to make the daily manual tasks easier to perform so I could focus on learning more PowerShell and Python. I was in only this initial position for a short period of time until I was promoted to Systems Engineer and had my workload adjusted based on performance.
    highlights:
      - Developed automation for provisioning/deprovisioning resources in Google
        and Active Directory to meet SLAs.
      - Automated email collection via Gmail API for customer-contact tracking
        and productivity metrics.
      - Automated multiple processes for my team that were previously manual
        tasks.
      - Built a Windows Rundeck node to fill a knowledge gap and enable other
        team members to easily run jobs and scripts in a safe, contained
        environment.

      As a Sales and Support Engineer for our enterprise customers, I was
      involved with working with our Sales team to information around the
      technical implementation of the hardware, software and overall service we
      provided as a VoIP company. Our customers were ours for the length of
      their contract as well, we were their dedicated TAMs after signing.
    highlights:
      - Originally hired as a Tier I technician, assigned to the routing
        department while still in the probation period due to skills shown with
        identifying routing issues with deep packet inspection.
      - Chosen within the first 6 months of employment to move up to our select
        business engineering department due to the ability to absorb knowledge
        quickly and eagerness to learn and expand my skill-set. Chosen out of a
        pool of ~60 residential technical support agents to move up to the much
        smaller business department, most of which had been at the company
        considerably longer than myself at that point.

        resulting in unifying the infrastructure configurations across all
        environments and removing the need for manual configuration changes.

        roles and policies, security groups, and VPC design.
