Once Jekyll is running, you can start with basic configuration by adding various entries to `_config.yml`.
Besides the documentation here, the [default `_config.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_config.yml)
is also documented extensively.

**NOTE**: When making changes to `_config.yml`, it is necessary to restart the Jekyll process for the changes to take effect.

## Table of Contents
{:.no_toc}
0. this unordered seed list will be replaced by toc as unordered list
{:toc}

## Setting `url` and `baseurl`
The first order of business should be to set the correct `url` and `baseurl` values in `_config.yml`.

The `url` is the domain of your site, including the protocol (`http` or `https`). For this site, it is

~~~yml
url: https://qwtel.com
~~~

If your entire Jekyll blog is hosted in a subdirectory of your page, provide the path in `baseurl` with a leading `/`, but no trailing `/`,
e.g.

~~~yml
baseurl: /hydejack
~~~

Otherwise, provide the empty string `''`

### GitHub Pages
When hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (unless you are using a custom domain), the `url` is

~~~yml
url: https://<username>.github.io
~~~

The `baseurl` depends on the kind of page you are hosting.

* When hosting a *user or organization page*, use the empty string.
* When hosting *project page*, use `/<reponame>`.

For for information on the types of pages you can host on GitHub, see the
[GitHub Help article](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

## Changing accent colors and sidebar images
Hydejack allows you to choose the background image of the sidebar, as well as the accent color
(color of the links, selection and focus outline, etc...) on a per-page, per-category, per-tag, per-author and global basis.

Set the fallback values in `_config.yml`, which are used should no other rule (page, category, tag, author) apply:

~~~yml
accent_image: {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/sidebar-bg.jpg
accent_color: '#A85641'
~~~

**NOTE**: I recommend using a blurred image in order for the text to remain readable.
If you save a blurred image as JPG, it will also drastically reduce its file size.

The `accent_image` is optional. If you leave it out, Hydejack will use the `accent_color` as background (slightly darkened).
You can also provide a single color instead of an image like this:

~~~yml
accent_image:
  background: '#202020' # provide a valid CSS background value
~~~

## Changing fonts
Hydejack lets you configure the font of regular text and headlines and it has built-in support for Google Fonts.
There are three keys in `_config.yml` associated with it: `font`, `font_heading` and `google_fonts`.
The defaults are:

~~~yml
font:         "'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"
font_heading: "'Roboto Slab', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"
google_fonts: "Roboto+Slab:700|Noto+Sans:400,400i,700,700i"
~~~

`font` and `font_heading` must be valid CSS `font-family` values. When using Google Fonts make sure they consist of at least two fonts
(everything except the first entry will be used as a fallback until the fonts have completed loading).

The `google_fonts` key is the string necessary to fetch the fonts from Google.
You can get it from the download page at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) after you've selected one or more fonts:

![Where to get the google_fonts string]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/docs/google-fonts.png)

### Using safe web fonts
If you prefer not to use Google Fonts and use [safe web fonts](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) instead,
set `no_google_fonts` to `true`:

```yml
hydejack:
  no_google_fonts: true
```

In this case, `font` and `font_heading` do not have to contain more than one font.
You may also remove the `google_fonts` key in this case.

## Choosing a blog layout
Hydejack features two layouts for showing your blog posts.

* The [`list` layout][posts] only shows the title and groups the posts by year of publication.
* The [`blog` layout][blog] is a traditional paginated layout and shows the title and an excerpt of each post.

In order to use the `list` layout add the following front-matter to a new markdown file:

~~~yml
---
layout: list
title:  Home
---
~~~

If you want to use the `blog` layout, you need to add the `paginate` and `paginate_path` keys to your config file, e.g.

~~~yml
paginate:      5
paginate_path: '/page-:num/'
~~~

The `blog` layout needs to be applied to a file with the `.html` file extension
and the `paginate_path` needs to match the path to the `index.html` file,
i.e. if you want the blog to appear at `/blog/`, put a `index.html` in the `blog` dir and set `paginate_path` to be `/blog/page-:num/`.

For more information see [Pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/).

## Adding an author
As a bare minimum, you should add an `author` key with a `name` and `email` sub-key
(used by the [feed plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed)) to to your config file:

~~~yml
author:
  name:  Florian Klampfer
  email: mail@qwtel.com
~~~

If you would like the author to be displayed in the about section below a post or project\*,
as well as the top of about and welcome\* pages, add an `about` key and provide some markdown content.
I recommend using the YAML pipe `|` syntax, so you can include multiple paragraphs:

~~~yml
author:
  name:  Florian Klampfer
  email: mail@qwtel.com
  about: |
    Hi, I'm Florian or @qwtel...

    This is another paragraph.
~~~

### Adding an author's picture
If you'd like for the author's picture to appear in addition the the about text (see above),
you have to provide an URL to the `picture` key:

~~~yml
author:
  picture:  {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/me.jpg
~~~

If you'd like to provide multiple versions of the picture for screens with different pixel densities,
you can provide `path` and `srcset` keys instead.

~~~yml
author:
  picture:
    path:   {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/me.jpg
    srcset:
      1x:   {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/me.jpg
      2x:   {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/me@2x.jpg
~~~

The `path` key is a fallback image for browsers that don't support the `srcset` attribute.

The keys of the `srcset` hash will be used as image descriptors.
For more information on `srcset`, see the
[documentation at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-srcset), or
[this article from CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/).

### Adding social media icons
Hydejack supports a variety of social media icons out of the box.
These are defined on a per-author basis, so make sure you've followed the steps in [Adding an author](#adding-an-author).

**NOTE**: If you are using the gem-based version of Hydejack,
download [`social.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_data/social.yml)
and put it into `_data` in the root directory.
This is necessary because gem-based themes do not support including `_data`.
{:.message}

You can add a link to a social network by adding an entry to the `social` key in to an author.
It consists of the name of the social network as key and your username within that network as value, e.g.

~~~yml
author:
  social:
    twitter: qwtel
    github:  qwtel
~~~

Check out [`authors.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_data/authors.yml) to see which networks are available.
You can also follow the steps [here](advanced.md) to add your own social media icons.

You can change the order in which the icons appear by moving lines up or down, e.g.

~~~yml
author:
  social:
    github:  qwtel # now github appears first
    twitter: qwtel
~~~

To get an overview of which networks are available and how a typical username in that network looks like,
see the included [`authors.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_data/authors.yml).

Should providing a username not produce a correct link for some reason, you can provide a complete URL instead, e.g.

~~~yml
social:
  youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu0PYX_kVANdmgIZ4bw6_kA
~~~

**NOTE**: You can add any platform, even if it's not defined in [`social.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_data/social.yml),
by providing a complete URL. However, a fallback icon <span class="icon-link"></span> will be used when no icon is available.
Supplying your own icons is an [advanced topic](advanced.md).
{:.message}


### Adding an email or RSS icon
If you'd like to add email <span class="icon-mail"></span> or RSS <span class="icon-rss2"></span> to the list, add the `email` and `rss` keys, e.g.:

~~~yml
social:
  email: mailto:mail@qwtel.com
  rss:   {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml # make sure you provide an absolute URL
~~~

## Enabling comments
Hydejack supports comments via [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).
Before you can add comments to a page you need to register and add your site to Disqus' admin console.
Once you have obtained your "Disqus shortname", you include it in your config file:

~~~yml
disqus: <Disqus shortname>
~~~

Now comments can be enabled by adding `comments: true` to the front matter.

~~~yml
---
layout:   post
title:    Hello World
comments: true
---
~~~

You can enable comments for entire classes of pages by using
[front matter defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults).
E.g. to enable comments on all posts, add to your config file:

~~~yml
defaults:
  - scope:
      type: posts
    values:
      comments: true
~~~


## Enabling Google Analytics
Enabling Google Analytics is as simple as setting the `google_analytics` key.

~~~yml
google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X
~~~

Conversely, if you want to disable it, you only have to remove the key and no GA code will be part of the generated pages.

## Changing built-in strings
You can change the wording of built-in strings like "Related Posts" or "Read more" in `_data/strings.yml`.
If you are using the gem-based version, you can get the default file
[here](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_data/strings.yml).

You will frequently find markers like `<!--post_title-->`.
You can place them freely within your string and they will be replaced with the content they refer to.

You may also use this feature to translate the theme into different languages.
In this case you should also set the `lang` key to your config file, e.g.

```yml
lang: cc-ll
```

where `cc` is the 2-letter country code and `ll` specifies a 2-letter location code, e.g.: `de-at`.

You may also change the strings used for formatting dates and times (look out for the `date_formats` key),
but be aware that the values you provide need to be valid
Ruby [format directives](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Time.html#method-i-strftime).
